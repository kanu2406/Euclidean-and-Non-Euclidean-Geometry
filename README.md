# Exploring Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometry

This repository contains the report and presentation titled **"Exploring Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometry"**,done in the third year of my course B.Sc. Hons Mathematics, which investigates the historical and mathematical development of Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometry, leading to profound conclusions about the structure of space and its practical applications.

## Introduction

The report delves into the history of **Euclidean Geometry** and its long-standing dominance in mathematics, centered around **Euclid's Five Postulates**. The focus is on the **Fifth Postulate**, also known as the parallel postulate, which led to major breakthroughs in Non-Euclidean Geometry. We explore two alternatives:
1. **Spherical Geometry**, where no lines through a point are parallel.
2. **Hyperbolic Geometry**, where more than one line through a point is parallel.

Through these geometries, we investigate concepts such as geodesics, spherical and hyperbolic triangles, their areas, and the failure of the Fifth Postulate. Finally, the report explores practical applications of Non-Euclidean Geometry in fields such as **Hyperbolic Neural Networks**, **Cosmology**, and **Spherical Geometry in Navigation**.
